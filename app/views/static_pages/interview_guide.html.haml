      Tips for interviewers:
    %ul
      %li
        Ask open-ended questions that will lead to concrete answers.
      %li
        Example: What was your childhood home like? Who else lived in the house with you? What did your bedroom look like?
      %li
        Consider the order of questions. The progression of questions is important for establishing rapport and eliciting memories. Start with fact-based warm-up questions before moving on to more complex questions. You can choose two or three of the suggested questions below to get the conversation started.
      %li
        Listen more than speak. Allow time for the interviewee to fully answer the question.
      %li
        Listen with curiosity. Be willing to go “off script” and follow the direction of the conversation with follow-up questions.
