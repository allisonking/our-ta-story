        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. It is the responsibility of all users and of www.OurTAStory.com to revisit this page to check for changes. By accessing or using any part of the Website, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, then you may not access the Website or use any services.  We know that legal terms can be boring and dry, but this Privacy Policy plays an important role in your understanding of the information we collect from you and how we use it. We ask that you take some time to read through them. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at info@ourtastory.com</p>

<h3>Generally</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for Our TA Story, (“Our TA Story,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) which owns and operates the website www.ourTAStory.com, its associated sub-pages, and our mobile applications (the “Services”), and explains how we use the personal information collected from anyone who accesses or uses the Site in any way (“you,” “your,” or “User”). This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us and not to any third party websites that it may link to. It will notify you of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you by us through your use of the Services, how it is used, and with whom it may be shared;</li>
<li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data;</li>
<li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information; and</li>
<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>United States Privacy Standards</h3>
<p>By using www.ourtastory.com, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States (“U.S.”). If you reside outside the U.S. your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By visiting our Site and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the U.S.</p>

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) means information that can be used to identify a certain individual User, including Contact Data (e.g., your name, address, email address, user name, or password), and Demographic Data (e.g., zip code, gender, or age). PII is captured only when a User accesses the Services and willingly discloses that information. We may collect information from a third party that is not a User as necessary, but we only use this information for the sole purpose of administering Services for our Users. Finally, your contact information that you reveal to us, such as your name or business name, address, telephone number, and email, may become publicly accessible on the Site if you submit any Content, which may make such information searchable and visible to Users. Under certain circumstances, we may share User information with third parties for marketing purposes (see Information Collection and Use, below), and this Privacy Policy does not cover what other Users or third parties may do with your information. You may choose not to provide PII to us and may continue to use the Services.</p>

<h3>Terms of Service</h3>
<p>Please refer to our Terms of Service information on our other policies and guidelines for use of the Services.  In the event of any conflicting terms between this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service, the Terms of Service shall control.</p>

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p><i>Information Collected Upon Registration</i>. In order to make full use of the Services, you must submit certain PII to Our TA Story. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you use the Services, submit Content, and other present and future site interactions.</p>

<p><i>Use of Contact Information</i>. In addition, we may use your Contact Data to provide you with information about our products and services, including but not limited to services on ourTAStory.com. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, email info@ourtastory.com.  Generally, you may not opt-out of service-related or transactional communications that are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive service-related communication, you may email info@ourtastory.com.</p>

<p><i>Log and Traffic Data</i>. When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data" ). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. For most Users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Services, and for the Site's technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other PII to identify you personally, except as required to enforce this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use for the Website or as necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Our TA Story, its employees, customers, or other Users.</p>

<p>We also may collect Traffic Data, which is information about the types of Users that use the Site. We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site Traffic, display content according to your preferences, or to administer the Site, but this information is not examined for PII. User Data and Traffic Data may be shared with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous basis.</p>

<p><i>Aggregate Information We Access, Collect and Share</i>. Certain aggregate and non-personally identifiable information may be used by Our TA Story and shared with or sold to third parties. This information is not tied to you personally but may contain demographic information about Users in part or as a whole.</p>

<p><i>Cookies.</i> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user returns. Our TA Story uses cookies to help us identify and track users, their usage of the Site, and their website access preferences. Our TA Story visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our website, with the drawback that certain features of our Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<p><i>Web Beacons.</i> We employ software technologies (such as Google Analytics) that use clear gifs, or “web beacons” that help us track referrals from our partners or affiliates and better manage content to and on our Site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a User’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are small and embedded invisibly on web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to a User’s PII.</p>

<p><i>Do Not Track.</i> Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Our TA Story does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your PII with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.</p>

<h3>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h3>
<p>As noted above, you may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address given on the Services: (i) See what data we have about you, if any; (ii) change/correct any data we have about you; (iii) have us delete any data we have about you (subject to this section and Data Retention, below); or (iv) express any concern you have about our use of your data.</p>

<p>Please note that even if you opt out of any contracts from us, any PII, content, submission, or other posting or communication to you submitted to the Site prior to such termination shall not be removed unless we choose to do so at our option and in our sole discretion.</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>At a minimum, we will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may maintain some or all of this data in its archives even after it has been removed from the Site.</p>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>Our TA Story may transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Our TA Story believes in the privacy of our Users. Unfortunately, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure and we therefore cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the Site, and provide all information at your own risk. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR THE THEFT, LOSS, OR INTERCEPTION OF, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR DAMAGES TO, YOUR DATA OR COMMUNICATIONS BY USING THE SITE AND OUR SERVICES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND ASSUME THESE RISKS. IF YOU BELIEVE YOUR PRIVACY HAS BEEN BREACHED THROUGH THE USE OF OUR SITE OR SERVICES, PLEASE CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY AT INFO@OURTASTORY.COM.</p>

<p>We will also make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
<p>OurTAStory.com and any Content posted on the Site may contain links or references to other websites. OurTAStory.com cannot control and cannot be held responsible for the content that appears on those sites and is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. Furthermore, Our TA Story is not responsible for the Privacy Policies of any third party site or for how they treat information about their users.  These third party sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information.  You may be consenting to those websites through use of ours. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements and terms of service for each of the other websites you visit.</p>

<h3>Social Media Widgets</h3>
<p>Our Site may include social media features, such as Facebook “like” buttons, or “Share This” widgets that run on our Site. These features may collect your IP address, which pages you visit on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly. These features and widgets may be hosted by a third party, and are governed by that third party’s terms and policies.</p>

<h3>Our Policy Towards Children</h3>
<p>The Site is not directed to persons under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info@ourtastory.com. We will take actions to promptly remove such data. We do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal identifiable Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change or modify any provisions of this Privacy Policy and any policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services at any time in our sole discretion and without liability to you. Any such changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting of revisions on the Services. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of such changes or modifications constitutes your acceptance thereof. Therefore, you should frequently review this Privacy Policy and all applicable policies or guidelines on the Services in order to understand the terms and conditions applicable to your use of the Services. If you do not agree to any changes or modifications to this Privacy Policy or to any applicable policies or guidelines, your sole recourse is to stop using the Services. If you feel that we are not abiding by this Privacy Policy or if you have any questions about the information you have shared with us, please contact us at info@ourtastory.com.
